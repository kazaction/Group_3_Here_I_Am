#How to run the web app 19-11-2025
First of all, from the VS code go to the terminal and open two separete termianls. In the first terminal go to the backend folder then to the db folder run the init_db.py "python init_db.py" (If is your first time running the program run it if not you dont have to) this create the database.db file. Then go back to the backend folder and run the app.py "python app.py", this will start the server. After you run the server go to the second terminal and run the npm start so the web app will start. To login to the app with the credential to test it go to the init_dp.py and there we have a test user take the credential and log in with them. In the end, you can test all the function the program has till now.
